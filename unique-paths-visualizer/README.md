# 🧽 Unique Paths Visualizer

A visual, interactive React application to explore **dynamic programming (DP)** and **shortest path algorithms**. Easily toggle between **Leetcode-style Unique Paths II** and **Dijkstra's shortest path**, build your own grid, and visualize the paths with animations.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Unique Paths II (DP)**: Visualizes total valid paths using a dynamic programming table. Implements logic based on [LeetCode - Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/).
- 📏 **Shortest Path Mode**: Uses a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm that supports 8-directional movement (diagonals included) for pathfinding.
- 👡️ **Interactive Grid Editor**:
  - Click or drag to add/remove obstacles.
  - In shortest path mode, drag Start (🟩) and End (🟦) nodes freely.
- 🧮 **DP Table Rendering**: Optionally display the number of ways to reach each cell in unique paths mode.
- 🔁 **Path Animation**: Each cell in a computed path lights up sequentially to demonstrate traversal order.
- 📀 **Resizable Grid**: Supports grids from 1×1 to 12×12 with smooth resets and state preservation.
- ⚡ Fast and reactive UI thanks to React + Vite + Tailwind.
